it is a project that monitors activities performed on the system by taling screenshot every five seconds,maintaining a record of all the keys pressed and mouse clicks also gives specific permissions to the files which the user selects.
can be started and stopped by a specific keyword just now (escape key)
it is hidden and protects the system and keeps an eye on the activities performed on it at a very cheap rate.
just download the .jar file and execute it.
